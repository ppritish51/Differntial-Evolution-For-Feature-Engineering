# Differntial-Evolution-For-Feature-Engineering
In this project we are going to introduce a new way to create new features in a dataset for machine learning algorithms. We will find interaction between features using differential evolution . We have applied the differential evolution in its crude form which give us a lot of future scope for improvement also.
